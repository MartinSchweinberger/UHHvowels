# Introduction

This repository contains the resources for the talk *An acoustic analysis of vowel production by L1-Chinese learners of English* by Martin Schweinberger on November 15, 2024, at the University of Hamburg.

The repository contains the following file types:

+ Rmd: these files contain the R notebooks detailing the analytical steps of the study. These files can be downloaded and thus allow the local reproduction of the study.
+ html: these files represent rendered R notebooks that can be viewed in any browser to see exactly what was done and why.
+ rda: these files are located in the data folder and contain the sharable data sets used in this study.
+ Rproj: the Rproj file is a so-called R project file which is a file manager necessary when reproducing the analysis locally (on your own PC). 

There are 3 Rmd and 3 html files which contain different steps of the analysis:

+ Part 1 files contain the first part of the analysis where the individual vowel tokens were extracted.
+ Part 2 files contain the data processing where the data sets were cleaned and evaluated.
+ Part 3 files contain the statistical analysis (only the Part 3 file is made available as an interactive Jupyter notebook which allows anyone to reproduce the statistical analysis via Binder.com).


# Interactive Reproduction

Below is the link to interactive notebook that enable anyone to reproduce the analysis step-by-step or code-chunk by code-chunk via virtual machines launched at Binder.org

[Interactive Statistical Analysis](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MartinSchweinberger/FREnglSW_interactive/main?labpath=ChnVwls_Part03_MuPDARF_interactive.ipynb)

 This interactive notebook is located in a separate GitHub repository (UHHvowels_interactive) which is specifically set up to launch the interactive Jupyter notebook in a virtual machine via Binder.org.
